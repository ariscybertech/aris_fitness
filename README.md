# Fitness-App
A cross platform mobile Fitness app.

Recently Hitesh sir (Official Youtube channel: Hitesh Choudhary) challenged us to create a mobile application for a fitness freak.
The challenge was divided into 3 stages with level of difficulty 
increasing at each stage.

I saw this video almost 5 days ago and I am a beginner in mobile development(Flutter) so I found it is a perfect project for me. I managed to create this app in 5 days and I know this app lacks many functionalites but since it was a clientwork so I added only those functionlities which were asked by the client. nothing more than that.

Also, if you want to challenge yourself too then link of the 
video is given below. give it a try

debug on any mobile device(android/ios).
